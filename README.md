# Kaggle_books.toscrape_Webscraping_and_Analysis

This is my first webscraping project. I got the data from books.toscrape and scraped it using Python (BeautifulSoup).

I wanted to identify the average book price, the average book rating, and the 50 most expensive books and their ratings.

I also wanted to check for correlation between price and rating.
